      I've been playing since middle school.  I really only play my
      accoustic these days and probably will as long as I'm living in a tiny
      apartment.  Lately I've been playing mostly finger-picking stuff like
      <em>Blackbird</em>, <em>Cello Song</em> by Nick Drake and
      <em>The Boxer</em> by Simon & Garfunkel.
